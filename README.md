# CS50-Week-0-Assignment

I will create a game for the assigned task.

The game would initially comprise of 3 sprites (wizard, bat, and lightning).

The wizard can move upward, downward, forward, and backward, and also attack with lightning.
The bat will randomly appear from the right side and will try to get pass the wizard.
